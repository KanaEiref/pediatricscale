			<h1> Topic: Health</h1>
			<h1> Goal: A single feature digital product.</h1>
			<h1> Product: Pediatric Scale </h1>
			<h2> Problem: The current two types of pediatric scales in pediatrician's office are very hard to use.
			</h2>
			<h2>
				Parents have hard ways to measure a wiggly baby at home, they have to wait the 3-month or 6-month checkup points to know baby's weight, because there is no better way to know the accurate number of baby's weight at home.
			</h2>
			<h2>
				Parents need to know the accurate number of the baby in order to know what they did wrong in terms of feeding..etc.
			</h2>
			<h1>
				New ideas: try to find a better shape to contain the squirmy baby
			</h1>
			<h2>
				fish tank shape, lotus flower shape , open jaw shape
			</h2>
			<h1>
				Problem still not solved: not comfortable for babies, whoever measures the baby need to try to comfort the baby while read the numbers on the LCD monitor.
				New Idea: a sling, soft fabric
			</h1>
			<h2> 
				Two ideas are generated here:
			</h2>
			<h2>A LCD monitor attached to the sling, OR
			</h2>
			<h2>
				An smart mobile phone case that hookup both monitor and the baby.
			</h2>
			<h2>
				Either way, the weight censor will be on the sling
			</h2>
			<h1>At a check-up meeting, Steve Hickey suggested blue tooth idea which separates teh measuring device with the monitor device.
			</h1>
			<h2>
				After calculating the cost, if we use the same resolution level LCD monitor, it is more cost effective to use bluetooth-smart phone approach than using the LCD_on_sling approach.
			</h2>
			<h1>
				Decision --> Bluetooth approach -- > Next: Prototype
			</h1>
			<h2>
				Using HTML5/CSS3/Javascript to develop different interfaces.</h2>
			<h2>    
				Using faces to indicate if the baby is gaining weight or losing weight.
			</h2>
			<h1>	Thanks for both Steve Hickey and TIm Wright for technical help.</h1>
